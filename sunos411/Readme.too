This Archive contains files and programs suitable for installing
SunOS 4.1.1 for sun3/sun3x architectures. It is derived from the
Sun3x install tapes and Sun3 "live" installs.

Legal Stuff  -- READ THIS!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This archive is for people who own a Sun3/Sun3x machine and wish to get it
running. We have had no explicit permission from Sun to publish this material,
having contacted Sun on the issue and had no reply in several months.

We see of no reason why owners of old Sun machines cannot
obtain a copy of install media, especially with Sun no longer supporting
these machines and telling customers to "get a copy elsewhere".

I (Stuart Croy) accept personal responsibility for the contents herein. If
you feel that maintaining this archive is unacceptable, please do not
hesitate to contact me.

Note that the distribution is not in the original format that Sun provided
and thus is not representative of the product that Sun shipped.
(The changes are slight however)

The files and programs in this archive are to be used at your own risk.
I will not be held responsible for damange to data or equipment incurred by
use of the above mentioned programs/files.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OK...

Scripts will be appearing soon to put together a Sun3/Sun3x boot tape or
'fake CD' install via disk or network.
`
I'm rather busy right now (just moved flat) and the other oldkit archive
maintainers are off on holiday, so things will be slooooow for a while.

It has been pointed out that sun3_openwindows_demos.tar.gz and
sun3_openwindows.user.tar.gz are corrupted. These file will be replaced
soon, when my 3/80 at home is back up.

As it happens I was just carrying a SunOs 4.1.1 tape about with me :)
and so the "sun3_openwindows_demos.tar.gz" and "sun3_openwindows.users.tar.gz"
have been restored.

I put this tape-images to www.sun3arc.org as a pure mirror of
what's on the original site. I don't know what the legal status is but
I'm sad of so many people asking me for boot-images and I always have to
say "sorry...Sun still holds the copyright so I can't put it up". Now I'm not
the first one to do this and my trials to get a statement from sun also 
failed because no one I asked could tell me who's responsible. So if I violate
something please tell me and I'll take this stuff away.

On wednesday, May 20th 1998 I got an answer to the legal status of puting
SunOS online from the sales-representive of SUN Microsystems Germany
(section Research&Education) and he allowed us to put the Bootimages online
as long as we don' use them in a commercial manner. Looks like if this
problem is solved...he allowed us even more but that takes some more
time...
